            <p>VS Code is file and folder based - you can get started immediately by opening a file or folder in VS
                Code.
                On top of this, VS Code can read and take advantage of a variety of project files defined by different
                frameworks and platforms. For example, if the folder you opened in VS Code contains one or more
                package.json, project.json, tsconfig.json, or ASP.NET Core Visual Studio solution and project files, VS
                Code will read these files and use them to provide additional functiona</p>
